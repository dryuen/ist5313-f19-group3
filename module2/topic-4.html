							<p>Although all health plans now offer mental health coverage, that doesn't necessarily mean that your claims are going to be processed through your medical insurance carrier. 
							Often times, behavioral health coverage is "carved out" of the medical plan and given to a third party administrator or TPA. 
							The third party administrator is often given to a carrier that specializes in behavioral health services. 
							TPA's are responsible for processing claims, prior-authorizations, and often times customer service for this type of coverage. 
							Insurance companies outsource the administrative needs of mental health coverage to these companies.
