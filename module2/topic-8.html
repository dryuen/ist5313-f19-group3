							<h2>Work/Life</h2>
							
							<p>A Work/Life program is a program that is often offered with employee assistance programs to help employees balance work and life. 
							Care managers can assist employees in locating a variety of resources. These resources include childcare, eldercare, legal assistance, financial resources, etc. 
							A work/life program is incredibly helpful to solve every day problems that may keep you from attending work. 
							This resource is often provided to you by your employer. 
							If you would like to know whether or not your employer offers this benefit, the Human Resources department is the best place to ask.
