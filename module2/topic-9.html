							<p>Mental Health insurance has to be covered the same amount as medical and surgical coverage, thanks to the ACA. How it’s covered can vary from plan to plan though so it’s important to read all of the policy wording and speak to your insurance if you have any questions about your coverage.  
							</p>
							
							<p>Third party administrators that specialize in behavioral health insurance are often the one that are in charge of claims processing and prior authorizations for services. It would be to your benefit to find out if your behavioral health services are handled by a third-party administrator so that you will know who to speak to and can stay informed of how your healthcare is being handled. 
							</p>		
							
							<p>Lastly, you have so many resources available for mental health services. Mental health resources have increased due to the decrease in cost for millions of Americans. This means that more people are getting the help they need. It’s still important to know though which providers can help you best according to your circumstances and resources that your employer offers. 
							</p>	
							
							<p>Mental health services are at last being covered as medical coverage is covered. Americans are much more likely to seek help which is so important for the health of every American. There are still things that we can still improve upon, such as incentivizing mental health providers to contract with insurance plans, but this is a good starting point.
