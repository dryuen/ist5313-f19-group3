						<p><h2>Mental Health Coverage History</h2></p>
							<img src="images/myImage1.jpg" alt="Mind illustration" class="mainImg">
							<p>Before the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2014, mental health services were covered in a very limited capacity if those services were covered at all. 
							This led many people to go without services that were needed. Some diagnoses, like bipolar disorder, prevented people from obtaining private health insurance in most states. 
							Even minor diagnoses meant that insurance companies could increase someone&#8217s premium during the underwriting process.</br>
							Insurance companies could do this because they considered mental health diagnoses as <q>pre-existing conditions</q>.
							</p>
							
							<p>Coverage was better for people that were covered by employer group health plans, but there was still a great disparity between medical coverage and behavioral health coverage.
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>Premium</strong> &#8208 Dollar amount that is paid to the insurance company for insurance coverage. Usually this is shared with the employer.
							</p>
							
							<p><strong>Mental Health Services</strong> &#8208 Assessment, diagnosis, treatment, or counseling to assist individuals or groups in alleviating mental or emotional illnesses and symptoms.
