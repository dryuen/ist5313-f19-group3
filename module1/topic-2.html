							<p>Access to mental health services before the ACA was very limited and networked providers further limited access to care for mental health services. 
							Out-of-Network providers are not contracted to accept the discounted rate that In-Network providers are contracted to accept. 
							This means that patients run the risk of being billed a very high amount from the behavioral health provider with little coverage from the insurance. 
							</p>
							
							<p>This practice prevented patients from seeking the care that they needed because they were fearful of receiving an expensive bill.
