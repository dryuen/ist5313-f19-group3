						<p><h2>Parity Laws</h2></p>
							<p>There was some progress before the ACA was enacted in 2014. Progress was made through two Parity Laws that passed in 1996 and 2008. 
							</p>
							
							<p>The Mental Health Parity Act of 1996 helped to level the field between medical coverage and behavioral health coverage. The MHPA required parity between medical coverage and behavioral health coverage. 
							This meant that behavioral health coverage had to have the same lifetime and annual dollar limits as medical and surgery coverage. 
							This didnâ€™t totally level the playing field though, as this law only applied to group health plans that already offered mental health benefits. It did not require plans to offer mental health coverage. 
							This act also led many insurance companies to increase cost sharing for their members. 
							This meant that members may pay a much higher copay to see a mental health provider as opposed to seeing their primary care provider.
							</p>
							
							<p>The Paul Wellstone and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act of 2008 superseded the MHPA of 1996. This MHPAEA filled in gaps that the MHPA left. 
							The MHPAEA required group health plans to cover behavioral health services at the same cost sharing rates as the medical services. 
							This helped many members gain access to behavioral health services that they did not have access to before due to expense. This act did not however require group health plans to offer mental health coverage. 
							This act only regulated those plans that already offered them.
