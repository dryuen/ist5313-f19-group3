							<p>Mental health services before the ACA were not comprehensive and many people were left without the care that they really needed. 
							The parity laws of 1996 and 2008 helped to broaden appropriate mental health coverage for millions of Americans, but there were still many gaps in mental health care. 
							One of the main changes that the ACA brought about was how we think of mental health care in this country.
							</p>
							
							<p>Due to the difference in care between medical coverage and mental health coverage, a stigma about seeking mental health care was reinforced. 
							When the ACA expanded mental health coverage by including mental health services as a minimum essential health benefit for all plans, now mental health services are given the same importance as medical services. 
							People are now more likely to seek appropriate treatment since this service is treated the same as if one was going to the doctor to get treated for the flu. 
							</p>
							
							<p>The ACA didn’t solve all the problems that still plague mental health coverage. Many behavioral health providers are Out of Network with most if not all plans because they don’t want to deal with the insurance companies. 
							Also, providers that have their own practice are also not incentivized to contract with insurance companies, because they would be put out of business if they accepted the discounted rate from the insurance company. 
							When seeing a mental health provider, the patients are put at risk of expensive bills still.
